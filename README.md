# Ecommerce Data Analaysis
**Purpose Statement**: To analyse factors contributing to a decline in sales for a cosmetics online store by examining key performance indicators(KPIs) and customer behaviour.

**A little about Data**: 
1. Data is collected from a cosmetics online store for 5 months between Oct 2019 and Feb 2020.
2. Contains customer behavior data including event time, event type, product category, user IDs
3. Source: eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop collected by Open CDP

**Analysis Steps**:
1. Created a data mart to streamline access to relevant data(session count, user count per events by day, week, month)
2. Examined ecommerce key performance indicators(KPIs) including CVR, AOV and website traffic
3. Analysed performance trend by top brands and products to check if they are negatively impacting the sales
4. Investigated repeat purchase and customer retention through cohort analysis

**Conclusions**:
1. Revenue continues its downwards trajectory since peak season (Black Friday & Christmas) last year.
2. Lower CVR from view (product page) to cart is one of the main reasons behind the drop in revenue in recent months.
3. A decline in retention rate is another factor contributing to the drop in sales. However, new customers are increasing average order value on their subsequent purchases.

**Next Steps**:
1. Improve CVR through view to cart funnel optimisation:
